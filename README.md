- Document generally how the overall system works (do briefly, make sure all views, models, classes have context)
- Provide educational materials for future members to work on this repository
- Document the AGV State Model (and how it's implemented in Code)
- Document how to add behaviors to the AGV State Model
  - Document the Command system (have yet to do that!)
